//! Sink abstraction: where ledger batches are committed.
//!
//! The bridge publishes one [`LedgerBatch`] at a time. A batch must be
//! committed **atomically together with its checkpoint** — that is what makes
//! the pipeline exactly-once across restarts. [`crate::kafka_producer`] does
//! this with a Kafka transaction; [`MemorySink`] models the same contract for
//! tests and load tests.
