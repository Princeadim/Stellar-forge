//! WebAssembly caching layer for the Stellar operator.
//
// This module provides an in-memory, concurrency-safe LRU cache for pre-compiled
// Wasmtime modules. It is designed to be shared across all worker threads of a
// single RPC node and to be invalidated instantaneously when a contract's underlying
// network state is upgraded or altered.
