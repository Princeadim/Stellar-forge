//! Stellar-K8s controller crate.
//!
//! This crate provides the deployment pipeline and admission webhook modules
//! used by the Stellar-K8s operator.  It is intentionally kept lean so it can
//! be compiled quickly and linked into the operator binary without pulling in
//! heavy optional dependencies.
//!
//! # Modules
//!
//! - [`apis`] — Custom resource validation and API schema utilities.
//! - [`deployment`] — StellarNode deployment pipeline, including the
//!   [`deployment::optimizer`] WASM bytecode optimizer.
//! - [`pdb`] — PodDisruptionBudget auto-tuning controller that keeps
//!   `maxUnavailable` at 0 while validators sync and only relaxes it to 1
//!   when the quorum can survive losing one validator.
//! - [`finalizers`] — Kubernetes finalizer cleanup recovery controller.
//!   Detects `StellarNode` resources stuck in `Terminating` state, verifies
//!   cloud storage detachment via AWS EBS / GCP PD APIs, and safely removes
//!   orphaned finalizers without risking data loss.
//! - [`quorum`] — Quorum-set graph analysis utilities.
