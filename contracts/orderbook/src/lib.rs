//! Library entry point for the decentralized autonomous orderbook.
//
//# Orderbook contract
//
// This crate exposes the on-chain limit order book engine. The public
// entrypoints are defined here and delegate to the modules `instruction`,
// `engine`, and `queue`. The contract keeps the library surface small and
// focuses on the acceptance criteria of the issue:
//
// - Price-time priority queues storing exact price points -> `queue`.
// - Limit order placement and instant market buys through a single entrypoint
//   -> `engine`.
// - Partial fill tracking and cleanup of fully filled orders -> `engine.
// - Bounded execution for large market sweeps -> `queue` + `engine`.
//
// The modules are declared here so that the contract can be built as a
// single WASM artifact. The actual implementation of the queue and engine
// lives in their respective modules.
